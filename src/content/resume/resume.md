## Experience
**Brevity** - Senior Web Developer
: *August 2025 -- present*

**KnowInk** - Senior Software Engineer II
: From modern React and Angular projects to Blazor and C#, I worked on implementing standards- and test-driven solutions. I helped build the foundations of a Stencil-based web component library to standardize our UX across many applications in multiple frameworks and languages. This component library was built test-driven with Testing Library, the same library used in countless React projects, and had 100% coverage. I also was charged with spearheading a Cypress test library to cover the TotalVote voter registration software to reduce the time required by QAs to manually test the application and catch potential bugs earlier in the development cycle.

**WWT/Asynchrony** - Lead UX Frontend Engineer
: Over the span of five years, I led dynamic teams in delivering innovative solutions for clients across diverse sectors, including banking, communications, utilities, education, and medical technologies. My expertise lies in leveraging modern frontend frameworks such as React and Angular, along with CMS software like Craft CMS. My unwavering focus on user experience ensures lightning-fast interfaces, highly accessible applications, and delightful interactions with every tap.
: Asynchrony practiced two distinct things with fervor: pair programming and test-driven development. At Asynchrony, I learned and honed my understanding of unit test-driven development and end-to-end testing with Selenium and Cypress. Write a test, write the passing code, refactor the code. This lead to all but one of my projects having 100% test coverage, including over everything from APIs, React API fetching, application logic, and UI components. You can call me a true believer.
: The last project I worked on was a PHP-based CMS-driven marketing site. I delivered multiple custom, PHP plugins for our client to allow customers to find and contact local clinics while making it painless for our customers to enter and update their information.

**Emerson Climate Technologies** - Front-End Web Developer

Additionally, I crafted a visually appealing marketing website for Sensi using Craft CMS. This website streamlined access to answers for common questions, highlighted new and upcoming features, and facilitated the purchase and installation of the Sensi thermostat.
: With Sensi's website powered by a version of Craft before migrations were added, I built a custom migration system in Node.js and mySQL that allowed us to deploy changes to Craft's configuration, including elements and fields as well as content from our Git repo. With migrations, we could develop and deploy using modern methods, including across multiple environments.

: My first tasks including optimizing a dashboard that took minutes to load.

**Echo Design Group** - Senior Web Developer
: Joining the team right as the whole Responsive Web Design movement kicked off, I built a dozen sites from start to launch, working with the design team to implement strong, mobile-friendly experiences. I also helped them improve their organizational workflow, including utilizing Github for deployment and version control and built a custom PHP and mySQL-powered CMS for managing web sites.
: Our custom CMS was built on the idea of editable and repeatable regions, countering the common pattern of a large WYSIWYG that WordPress was well-known for at the time. We could define pieces of content that a client could edit without giving them the ability to touch HTML and CSS, which often would lead to unintended consequences.
